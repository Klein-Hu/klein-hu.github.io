### General

The Open Data Protocol (OData) enables the creation of REST-based data services, which allow resources, identified using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and defined in a data model, to be published and edited by Web clients using simple HTTP messages.

It was proposed by Microsoft initially. So .Net framework suppports it for sure (.Net Core has not supported yet but there is an ongoing effort on it) and almost all language having their own version of library to support OData protocol.

The HTTP-based OData protocol has the regular HTTP methods. The major special parts are header fields, the URL (including query strings) and the requst/response body in JSON. 

* The OData specific key word in URL start with "$", such as "$filter", "$expand", "$top", "$ref" etc.
* In the Header fields, "OData-Version" and "Content-Type: application/json;odata.metadata=xxxx" is mandatory.
* The request and response body contains metadata field in the top level of JSON. The metadata name is like "@odata.xxx", such as "@odata.context", "@odata.nextLink", etc.

### Data Request

Data request is about fetching data via URL w/o any query string. The functionality of data request is limited with particular resource type of individual entity. It includes

* Request a collection

    `GET <service_root>/<resource_type>`

* Request one entity by its ID

    `GET <service_root>/<resource_type>('<resource_id>')`

* Request one entity's one property

    `GET <service_root>/<resource_type>('<resource_id>')/<property_name>`
    
    `GET <service_root>/<resource_type>('<resource_id>')/<property_name>/.../<property_name>`

* Request one entity's one property's raw value

    `GET <service_root>/<resource_type>('<resource_id>')/<property_name>/$value`

### Data Query

When we talk about "data query" in OData, we are most likely talking about `$filter` and other keywords related to the query result. When we talk about `$filter` keyword, we need to mention the **"URL convention"** and **"Common Schema Definition Language (CSDL)"**. But in this session, we are going to mention some brief idea about them. Will have specific articles about them later.

Keywords for data query:

* $filter: 
* $expand
