[Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software) is a great tool to create diagrams, flowcharts for architecture, design, etc. But it is [not free](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/microsoft-visio-plans-and-pricing-compare-visio-options). I have it in office, but at home I could not use it. After some research, [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) came to my view.
