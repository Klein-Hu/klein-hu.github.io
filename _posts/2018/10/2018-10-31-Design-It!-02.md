The Book could be found here: [Design It!](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Programmer-Architect-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1680502093/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540791825&sr=8-1&keywords=design+it%21)

This is a reading notes of the book. It is the first design/architecture book I plan to ready. I have read some samples and seems a hands-on book. Will summarize whatever I learned to here.

## Design Thinking Fundamentals

Focusing on the people affected by your design decisions helps you concentrate on the exact problems that must be solved.

## H.A.R.T.

1. **H**uman rule. All design is social in nature.
2. **A**mbiguity rule. Preserve ambiguity.
3. **R**edesign rule. All design is redesign.
4. **T**angibility rule. Make ideas tangible to facilitate communication.

* Before we solidify a design decision, we can use ambiguity to keep options open.
* One of the least effective ways to design software architecture is to ignore the software systems that came before us.
* There are many ways to make architecture tangible. 
    * Draw it. 
    * Make it come alive in the code you write. 
    * Build prototypes that let people experience structures and quality attributes.
    * Create simple models that show how some part of the architecture works. 
    * Create relatable metaphors. 
    * Act out parts of the control flow of the system.

## Design Mindset

* Understand the Problem
    * In the understand mindset we actively seek information from stakeholders and work to describe the problem.
    * To understand the problem, weâ€™ll need to investigate business goals and quality attributes that are important to our stakeholders.
* Explore Ideas
    * Exploring software architecture means we try combinations of structures until we find a combination that best promotes desired quality attributes.
* Make It Real
    * The most common ways we make architecture real is by creating models.
* Evaluate Fit

## Think, Do, Check

A software system is never finished; it is only released.

* Think
    * Engineering risks
    * Business goals
    * Quality attibutes
    * Trade-offs
* Do
    * Models
    * Prototypes
    * Plans
    * List of alternatives
* Check
    * Scenario walkthroughs
    * Alternatives comparison
    * Direct tests
    * Comprehension check
