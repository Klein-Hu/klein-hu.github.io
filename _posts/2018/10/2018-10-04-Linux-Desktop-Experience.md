My Linux experience started with [Redhat](https://www.redhat.com/). I belive lots of people, especially people from Chinese univeristies and colleages like my age. After that was [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/). But the `rpm` package management system did hurt me a lot: it missed package dependency management for a while and it became a pain if some version mismatch happened....

I moved to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) for a short time before I moved to a Windows company. The `apt` system does have the package dependency management from beginning. But after that I have not touched Linux, especially using it out of work, for a long while, maybe about 7-8 year.

Since last year, Linux came back to my work and my home laptop becomes slow after one of the "best" Windows update. I decided to move back to Linux world on my home laptop as well! Then I tried:

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Kubuntu 16.04
- Xubuntu 16.04
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Kubuntu 18.04

(Don't blame me. I don't like mint and I don't like Linux Mint as well)

After a few month with Ubuntu 1[68].04, I still don't get use to the menu system, having hard time to find an icon. But I feel like its touch support not bad on my work machine. Kubuntu 1[68].04 are ones most close to Windows. Feel familiar on the first few days. But **IT IS SLOW!!** Several times stuck on a random application for a while and continue, which never happened to any other desktop environment.

Now it is the time to try something new! After some research, I decide to try a combination: Xubuntu 18.04 + Cinnamon: The small Xubuntu image plus a friendly Cinnamon UX. So far it works quite smoothly! Debugging never causes UX stuck any more! And the Cinnamon has more configuration settings than KDE. I just need to install back all my softwares to bring back the experience. Will write more about Cinnamon environment after a while.
