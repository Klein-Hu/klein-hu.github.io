Today I had a task to find all packages which has `copyright` file in their doc. Basically, I need to lisk all packages which has `copyright`. It is easy to find the path of the `copyright` file like `/usr/share/doc/gsfonts/copyright` but how to get the `gsfonts` out of the path, it needs a small script.

There are two choices:

* SED: `dirname "/usr/share/doc/gsfonts/copyright" | sed 's,^\(.*/\)\?\([^/]*\),\2,'`
* AWK: `awk -F/ '{ print $(NF-1) }' <<< "/usr/share/doc/gsfonts/copyright"`

Both working fine for me. But apparently the second one is easy to read.
