If any tool could save my time in repeat works, even though only few minutes per iteration, it is still good to learn.

### Why need this?

I usually like to do everything locally to make sure everything under my control. But recently, I need to create ARM docker image on my x64 machine. Then I have to setup [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and setup special environment for it. I'm lazy....

### How

The original way to build ARM image on x64 environment with QEMU locally is in the Dockerfile copy qemu-arm-static file

```Dockerfile
FROM arm32v7/ubuntu:18.04
COPY qemu-arm-static /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static
WORKDIR /myapp
ADD /myapp_binary .
RUN chmod +x ./myapp
ENTRYPOINT ./myapp
EXPOSE 80
```

But with ACR-Build, the `COPY qemu-arm-static /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static` could be removed from the `Dockerfile`! Then just run the following command

```bash
az acr build --registry <registry_name> -t <tag> <local_path>
```

Build + upload will happen after this command.

If you have something in GitHub, you could replace the `<local_path>` with GitHub URL and the build will happen as well. And this GitHub build scenario could happen in [CloudShell](https://shell.azure.com/), which means you even do not need to install anything locally.
