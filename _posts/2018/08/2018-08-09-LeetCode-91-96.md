This week problems are not quite hard but typical DP questions.

### [Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/)

Traditional [Climb stairs question](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_20916555/article/details/51106017). But the tricky part is how to handle `0` in the input string.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numDecodings(string s) {
        if (s.empty() || s[0] == '0') return 0;
        int N = s.length();
        vector<int> dp(N + 1, 1);
        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++)
        {
            if (s[i-1] == '0')
            {
                if (s[i-2] == '1' || s[i-2] == '2')
                {
                    dp[i] = dp[i-2];
                    continue;
                }
                else
                {
                    return 0;
                }
            }

            if (s[i-2] > '2' || s[i-2] == '0' || (s[i-2] == '2' && s[i-1] > '6')) dp[i] = dp[i-1];
            else dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }

        return dp[N];
    }
};
```

### [Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/description/)

If this question solve as [Unique Binary Search Trees II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/description/), it will be TLE, becuase the judge wouldn't care how the tree look like, just need the count. Then it becomes a DP: left and right sub-tree could should be remembered per how many nodes in it. 

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)
            {
                dp[i] += dp[j-1] * dp[i-j];
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
