In 199x, if some one talks about using Linux as personal OS, not directly for work or education purpose, people will feel like he/she is crazy. But now, it has been ~20 years later. Could it be possible? I have started using Ubuntu and Kubuntu 18.04 at home since 3 months ago. Seems pretty smooth than 20 years ago. I will share some of tools and setup working great for me.

First thing is my laptop with Linux should be able to help me working from home. Otherwise, I will have to need another computer. Since 2 of 3 my office PCs are Windows 10, I need to have a solution for RDP. (BTW, install a RealVNC server, setup a team and then access from home should work, but it seems not quite secure to me. So I give up this path)

Kubuntu has KRDC and Ubuntu has [Remmina](https://remmina.org/). I have tried both. Apparently Remmina wins: it supports "Proxy" when connect to a work PC. Almost every company don't want the dev box could be reach by Internet directly. So it needs a solution for outside to find the internal PC. Remmina has it. It also allows you setup SSH connection for RDP. 

Remmina has an open architecture and allow plugins. By default, you will have RDP, VNC, SSH, NX and SPICE support from corresponding plugins.
