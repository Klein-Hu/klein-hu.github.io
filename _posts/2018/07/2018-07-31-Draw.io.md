[Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software) is a great tool to create diagrams, flowcharts for architecture, design, etc. But it is [not free](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/microsoft-visio-plans-and-pricing-compare-visio-options). I have it at work, but at home I could not use it. Not only expensive, but also I'm using Linux in my home PC. After some research, [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) becomes handy.

### What I Care

1. Free
2. Save/Load a file locally
3. Could be export to multiple format for different purpose, at least JPG/PNG/SVG
4. As many build-in shapes as possible
5. UI should be modern, should not be Win 98/XP styles
6. If it is offline, better support Linux since my home PC (Ubuntu 18.04) and my daughter's PC (Ubuntu 16.04) are both Linux.

### What Draw.io Provides

1. Free
2. Save to Google Drive, Dropbox and local.
3. Export to multiple formats: JPG/PNG/SVG/PDF/VSDX/XML/HTML
4. Could generate a link to publish
5. Multiple templates and shapes built in. Most of them for CS.
6. UX is not fancy but good enough.
7. Has offline version for all major platforms.

### What Else

There are some other choices:

1. [ASCII Flow](http://asciiflow.com/), online, it could export to ASCII art. 
2. [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/), for simple graph visualization
3. [Libra Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/), default version 5 is not quite interesting but it is a choice when you have Ubuntu in hand.
