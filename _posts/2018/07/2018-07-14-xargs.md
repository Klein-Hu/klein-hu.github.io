Try to clean up my local docker images (> 50 images) and make no sense to delete them one by one. So there must be an automated solution: `docker` -> `grep` -> `awk` -> `xargs`.

# What is `xargs`

`xargs` reads items from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or new lines, and executes the command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with any initial-arguments followed by items read from standard input. Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.

# Why `xargs`

1. Not all programs in CLI take input from pipe. `xargs` could help you build the command line from the pipe output.
2. Some command like `find` could also execute a command, but `xargs` could execute the generated command in parallel, using `-P` option.
3. How to split the pipe or file input into parameters, there are several control parameters: `-n`, `-s`, `-L`, etc.
4. Deliminater could also be customized by `-d`

# Examples

1. Remove test docker images

    ```bash
    docker images -a | grep "testimg" | awk '{print $3}' | xargs -n 1 docker rmi -f 
    ```
2. Download all PDFs from a web site

    ```bash
    wget -O - "http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~stanchen/spring16/e6870/slides/" | grep -Po '>lecture.*\.pdf' | sed -e 's/>//' | xargs -n 1 echo | awk '{print "http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~stanchen/spring16/e6870/slides/"$1}' | xargs -n 1 wge
    ```
