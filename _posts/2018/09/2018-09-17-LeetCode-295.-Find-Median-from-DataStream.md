Original Problem: [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/)

First time trying this problem was not able to make it and learned from discussions. This is the second try.

In this try, I could figure out I need to `vector`s and a middle value. To make these 2 `vector`s could provide the largest on "left" and smallest on "right", I have tried several solution:

1. Simply run `sort` on each of them. Hit TLE on test case 16.
2. Use `make_heap`, because I really do not need both vectors are actually in order, I just need the largest on "left" and the smallest on "right". Hit TLE on test case 17.
3. At last I read the discussion and apparently they use `priority_queue`. But according to [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue) and [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/priority_queue/), it is using heap as well. So I need learn more about what's the difference between this solution and maintain heap by myself.

```C++
class MedianFinder {
private:
    int median;
    priority_queue<int> left;
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> right;
    bool is_median_valid;
public:
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    MedianFinder() {
        median = 0;
        is_median_valid = false;
    }
    
    void addNum(int num) {
        if (is_median_valid)
        {
            if (num > median)
            {
                left.push(median);
                right.push(num);
            }
            else
            {
                left.push(num);
                right.push(median);
            }
            
            is_median_valid = false;
        }
        else
        {
            if (left.empty())
            {
                median = num;
                is_median_valid = true;
                return;
            }
            else
            {
                if (num >= left.top() && num <= right.top())
                {
                    median = num;
                    is_median_valid = true;
                    return;
                }
                
                if (num < left.top())
                {
                    median = left.top();
                    left.pop();
                    left.push(num);
                }
                else
                {
                    median = right.top();
                    right.pop();
                    right.push(num);
                }
                
                is_median_valid = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    double findMedian() {
        if (!is_median_valid && left.empty()) return 0;
        
        if (is_median_valid) return (double)median;
        else return (left.top() + right.top()) * 1.0 / 2;
    }
};
