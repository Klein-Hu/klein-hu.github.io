To use an OS at home, you could not avoid Office - Do not have to be Microsoft Office, but at least some kind of Office suite. Of course, we want it could support the file format of Microsoft Office to make the communication with other people easier.

On Ubuntu 18.04, the default Office is [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) 6.0.3. It has lots of improvement comparing with 5.x on Ubuntu 16.04. One if the interesting part is the "Notebook Bar", which is a simulation of Microsoft Office ribbon.

Kids are already familiar with the concept of ribbon and refuse to use the small button toolbars any more. The LibreOffice actually provides lots of functions for you. I would say most of work could be done by it.

If you are on Ubuntu 16.04, you actually have a better choice (which does not support 18.04 yet): [WPS](http://wps-community.org/)! It looks way better than LibreOffice and provide similar experience on Windows. My daughter chose to install Ubuntu 16.04 other than 18.04!
