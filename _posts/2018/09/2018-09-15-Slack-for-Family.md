If you have two kids, one in middle school and another one in elementary school. Each of them having lots of after-school classes and events need to attend. Two parents also have lots of after-work tasks need to manage. A paper calendar or calendar on one phone will not be good enough.

Originally, I plan to write a web site for my family to display all informations for the whole family: Calendar, ToDos, blog, photos, etc. But there will be many things I need to worry about, such as auth, layout on different screen size, etc. I have my own work and after work tasks. I like to do so but may not have enough time.

Any existing solutions? As a developer, I start looking around to see if any daily software also family friendly and better free to use. After tried several different websites and tools in app store. Here is my list which could all be connected with Slack.

* [Slack](https://slack.com/)
* [Slack To-do bot](https://slack.com/apps/A0HBTUUPK-to-do)
* [Trello](https://slack.com/apps/A074YH40Z-trello)
* [Google Calendar](https://slack.com/apps/A0F8149ED-google-calendar)
* [Slack RSS App](https://slack.com/apps/A0F81R7U7-rss)
* [Slack MindMup App](https://slack.com/apps/ACN2KEEF5-mindmup)

The reason I choose them:

* Slack To-do bot: Best task management bot. I could assign to-do to my daughter. She could do it for me as well. We will see notification on our iPads and phones. It also has its own web site to manage the calendar as well.
* Trello: is the best project management dashboard. My kids use it to manage their school projects. It will also be used by their after-school club project, e.g. Robotics.
* Google Calendar is better than Outlook calendar free version. The whole family share one calendar and we could see our night and weekend plan any time on any device.
* RSS app is for reading. We have different interest points, but we don't have time to look for all news. Register some RSS with this app and we will receive notification if there is any update.
* MindMup is a free mind map web app. Kids could use it for brainstorming their projects or plan for a trip. 

This list will be extended if we figure out more interesting app or bot. For example, I'm investigating the IFTTT app. If it is good, I will update this post for it.
