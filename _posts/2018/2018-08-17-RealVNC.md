### What I need

I have 1 Ubuntu 16.04 box and 1 Raspberry Pi 3 in office, for coding and validation on hardware. I need to access them from home computers: 2 Windows PC and 1 Ubuntu 18.04. 

### Options

There are apparently several options:

1. VPN to Windows PC in office, from there using SSH or VNC
2. Sync code to cloud from office and sync back to home PC. Of course, I need to take the Raspberry Pi with me if I want to verify something.
3. A VNC solution could get through the VPN and reach the Ubuntu 16.04 in office

### Why RealVNC

1. With "Home" subscription, I could have 5 PC in the "Team" and access them from anywhere
2. RealVNC server is not heavy and chatty if I'm not using it.
3. Raspberry Pi latest OS contains the RealVNC server. I don't even have to install it. Just turn it on.
4. Client support multiple OS.

## Experience

1. So far so good on Windows client. No any issue found.
2. On Ubuntu 18.04, the `Ctrl-` shortcut does not work, which means copy/paste not working. This is annoying and still looking for a fix. But it is a blocking issue, because the mouse right click so far still working for me.
