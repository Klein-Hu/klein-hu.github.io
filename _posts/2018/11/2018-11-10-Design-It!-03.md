The Book could be found here: [Design It!](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Programmer-Architect-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1680502093/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540791825&sr=8-1&keywords=design+it%21)

This is a reading notes of the book. It is the first design/architecture book I plan to ready. I have read some samples and seems a hands-on book. Will summarize whatever I learned to here.

# Design Activities

Look for a satisficing design by emphasizing the following activities:

* Treat solutions as experiments.
* Focus on reducing risks.
* Iterate quickly to learn quickly.
* Think about the problem and solution at the same time.

# About Design Up Front

* The bigger the software system, the greater the benefits youâ€™ll reap from up-front architecture design.
* Smaller (10 KSLOC) software systems gain little from up-front architecture planning.
* Expect violent thrashing if you invest little into architecture design.
* The more you invest in architecture, the less rework will be required.

Measure how much design work we need:

* Size
* Complexity
* Volatility

Try the COSYSMO and COCOMO II tools with your project data. (COSYSMO = **Co**nstructive **Sys**tems Engineering **Mo**del, COCOMO II = **Co**nstructive **Co**st **Mo**del II)
