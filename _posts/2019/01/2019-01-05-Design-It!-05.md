The Book could be found here: [Design It!](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Programmer-Architect-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1680502093/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540791825&sr=8-1&keywords=design+it%21)

This is a reading notes of the book. It is the first design/architecture book I plan to ready. I have read some samples and seems a hands-on book. Will summarize whatever I learned to here.

## Summary

An **a**rchitecturally **s**ignificant **r**equirement, or **ASR**, is any requirement that strongly influences our choice of structures for the architecture.

* Constraints: Unchangeable design decisions, usually given, sometimes chosen.
* Quality Attributes: Externally visible properties that characterize how the system operates in a specific context.
* Influential Functional Requirements: Features and functions that require special attention in the architecture.
* Other Influencers: Time, knowledge, experience, skills, office politics, your own geeky biases, and all the other stuff that sways your decision making.

## Constraints

All constraints limit choice, but well-chosen constraints simplify the problem and can make it easier to design a satisficing architecture.

Business constraints limit decisions about people, process, costs, and schedule. Technical constraints limit decisions about the technology we may use in the software system.

**Constraints, once decided, are 100 percent non-negotiable**; if not, then it is not constraints. Be conservative in accepting constraints.

## Quality Attributes

Quality attributes define how well a system should perform some action.

Scalability, availability, and performance are meaningless by themselves. Good response measures are testable.

If you can’t write a test using your scenario, then the scenario does not have a specific, measurable response measure.

## Look for Classes of Functional Requirements

When a functional requirement drives architectural decision making, we call it an **influential functional requirement**. Influential functional requirements can be referred to as **architecture killers**.

Identifying influential functional requirements is equal parts art and science. It becomes easier with experience. Here’s how I do it:

1. Start with a notional architecture sketch that summarizes your current thinking about the architecture.
2. Identify general classes of requirements that represent the same type of architectural problem.
3. For each problem class identified, walk through the notional architecture and show how to achieve each requirement group. If it is not immediately obvious how you would implement the feature based on the known coarse-grained requirements, it might have architectural significance.

Here comes the strategy:

* Look for functional requirements that might be implemented within the same architectural elements. For example, features that require persistence go in one group whereas features that require user interaction go in another.
* Look for functional requirements that seem difficult to implement. These could be significant to the architecture.
* Look for high-value, high-priority functional requirements.

Reference any influential functional requirements in your architecture documentation but avoid duplicating the requirements engineering effort. Our goal is to call attention to critical features that influence our decision making.

## What Else Influnces the Architecture

Your skills and experience as an architect determine how you approach design and the architecture options available to you. 

Your knowledge and your team’s knowledge of technology defines your design vocabulary.

    …organizations which design systems…are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

## Dig for the Information You Need

The product backlog contains a treasure trove of ASRs. 

Quality attributes are implied or assumed in nearly every functional requirement.

Other activities:

* Activity 3: ​Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Workshop
* Activity 4: ​Interview Stakeholders
* Activity 5: ​List Assumptions​
* Activity 7: ​Mini-Quality Attribute Workshop​
* Activity 24: ​Inception Deck

As an active listener, you need empathy to put words into their cultural context and understand them. Remain quiet, don’t judge, and ask questions to help you understand.

Features alone are not enough information for us to design a software system. It’s the architecturally significant requirements, especially quality attributes, that drive architectural decision making.
