2017 is here. But I started thinking about the new year resolution since mid-Dec and ...

Here comes my plan (no order):

  - Loss weight to less than 170 lbs and keep it to the end of the year.
  - Workout at least 3 times a week
  - Write tech blog to summarize takeaways and reading notes, at least 1 per month
  - Bring my side-project online and keep it running.
