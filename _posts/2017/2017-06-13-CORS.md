### What is Origin
The definition of "Origin" is in [RFC6454](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454). If two URIs are the same in *schema*, *host*, *port*, we could treat them are the same origin.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`scheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]`


### Same-Origin Security Policy
**Same-origin security policy** is a **client** side security requirement. Under the policy, a **web browser** permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same origin. 

Here is a security risk without same-origin policy from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy#Security_Applications):

> Assume that a user is visiting a banking website and doesn't log out. Then, the user goes to another site that has some malicious JavaScript code running in the background that requests data from the banking site. Because the user is still logged in on the banking site, the malicious code could do anything the user could do on the banking site. For example, it could get a list of the user's last transactions, create a new transaction, etc. This is because the browser can send and receive session cookies to the banking site based on the domain of the banking site.

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
CORS is a "protocol" between server and client to clarify if any action (HTTP method + headers) is allowed by the server. Although some validation and authorization can be performed by the server, it is generally **the browser's responsibility** to support these headers and honor the restrictions they impose.

### How It Works
The CORS includes some client side work and two types of service side handling. The basic work flow is like below:

#### Client Side
Workflow from Wikipedia ([Click here to visit Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing#How_CORS_works), if you can't see the flow chart below)
![Client Workflow](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Flowchart_showing_Simple_and_Preflight_XHR.svg/1024px-Flowchart_showing_Simple_and_Preflight_XHR.svg.png)

#### Server Side (Simple CORS Request)
##### Precondition 
A HTTP request match **ALL** below conditions:
1. The HTTP method limited to `GET`, `POST` and `HEAD`.
2. The request from client needs to have the `Origin` header. 
3. If the HTTP method is `POST`, the header `Content-Type` is limited to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`.

##### Business Logic
If the origin is allowed by the server, the server will response the request with `Access-Controll-Allow-Origin` header and the value of this header is the same as the origin from client, then client access is allowed; otherwise, it is not allowed. If the `Access-Controll-Allow-Origin` is set to `"*"`, any origin is allowed. 

**Note**: If the resouce need to be accessed with credentials, the `Access-Controll-Allow-Origin` should **NOT** be set to `"*"` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` need to be set to `true`.

##### Sample
The HTTP request

    GET /api/version HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: Fiddler
    Accept: application/json
    Origin: http://foo.origin

The server response

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Date: Wed, 31 Nov 2100 19:42:00 GMT
    Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
    Content-Length: 53
    Connection: keep-alive
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://foo.origin

    [response payload]

#### Server Side (Preflight Request)
##### Precondition
A HTTP request match **ANY** of below conditions:
1. The HTTP method is **OTHER THAN** `GET`, `POST` and `HEAD`.
2. The request from client contains custom headers. 
3. If the HTTP method is `POST`, the header `Content-Type` is **OTHER THAN** `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`.

##### Client Side Additional Request
The client browser need to make an additional `OPTIONS` request with below header fields to the target server to clarify if the proposed request is allowed:
1. `Origin`: the origin of javascript
2. `Access-Control-Request-Method`: The proposed HTTP method
3. `Access-Control-Request-Headers`: The custom headers will be used in the actual request

##### Business Logic
If the request is not allowed, the server will response a 4xx error. 
If the request is allowed, the return will be 200 with the following headers:
1. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: the origin which is allowed. If it is a list, several origins will be separated by `","`.
2. `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: allowed HTTP methdods, separated by `","`
3. `Access-Control-Max-Age`: an integer, indicate how many **seconds** later the preflight will be expired.
4. `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: **Optional**, if credentials are need to access the resource, this need to be set to `true`.

##### Sample
The HTTP request

    OPTIONS /resources/31415926
    User-Agent: Fiddler
    Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
    Access-Control-Request-Headers: origin, x-requested-with, accept
    Origin: http://foo.origin

The server response

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2013 19:36:00 GMT
    Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
    Content-Length: 0
    Connection: keep-alive
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://foo.client.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 50000
