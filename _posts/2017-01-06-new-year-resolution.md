2017 is here. Something need to keep in mind. I started thinking abou the new year resolution since mid-Dec and here comes my plan (no order):
  - Loss weight to less than 170 lbs and keep it to the end of the year.
  - Workout at least 3 times a week
  - Write tech blog to summarize takeaways and reading notes, at least 1 per month
  - Bring my side-project online and keep it running.
