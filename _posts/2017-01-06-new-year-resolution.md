2017 is here. Something need to keep in mind. I started thinking abou the new year resolution since mid-Dec and here comes my plan (no order):
* Loss weight to < 170 lbs and keep it to the end of the year.
* Workout >= 3 times a week
* Write tech blog to summarize takeaways and reading notes, >= 1 per month
* Bring my side-project online and keep it running.
