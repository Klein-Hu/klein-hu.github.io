This is the reading notes of Paul Butcher's *Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks* - Functional Programming. The sample code is in [Clojure](http://clojure.org).

**Imperative Program**: consists of a series of statments that change global state when executed.
**Functional Program**: models computation as the evaluation of expressions, which are first-class and side-effect-free.
